## Running Instruction:

1. If you run this application for the first time, make sure to run `npm i` in both folders to install the necessary packages before attempting to run the app
2. Navigate to `backend` and enter `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `frontend` and enter `npm start`
4. Open your emulator, either from Android Studio or type `emulator -avd your_emualator_name` into the command line
5. If the application has not loaded yet, hit `a` on the `frontend` CLI, it will take a while for the application to be installed on your emulator
